            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Shape Modeling International (SMI), also known as International Conference on Shape Modeling and
                Applications, is an international forum for the dissemination of new mathematical theories and
                computational techniques for modeling, simulating, and processing digital representations of shapes and
                their properties to a community of researchers, developers, students, and practitioners across a wide
                range of fields. Initiated in 1997 by Tosiyasu L. Kunii, the symposium became an annual event in 2001
                after its merge with the Eurographics / ACM SIGGRAPH Workshop on Implicit Surfaces. The venue of the
                symposium rotates in turn among Asia, Europe, and America. Proceedings until the year 2010 are available
                at DPLP, computer.org, and IEEE Explore. Since 2009, SMI proceedings have been published by Elsevier as
                a special issue of the Computers & Graphics journal.
            </p>

            <h2 id="org">Shape Modeling International (SMI) Organization</h2>

            <h3 id="community">SMI Community</h3>
            <p>
                Everybody who contributed to the Shape Modeling International conference can be a member of the Shape
                Modeling International Community. Examples of contribution to SMI include publishing a paper in SMI,
                being a keynote speaker, serving on SMI committees, publishing and serving in Implicit Surfaces
                workshop, and publishing and serving in FASE and SCULPT events. The contributions to the area of Shape
                Modeling will also be considered for membership. The SMI steering committee (see below) will be
                responsible to keep a mailing list of the SMI Community. Steering Committee will invite contributors to
                the mailing list. The steering committee will also consider self-nominations.
            </p>

            <h3 id="council">Council</h3>
            <p>
                The SMI Council is a permanent committee whose role is: to maintain the quality and visibility of the
                conference; actively promote the conference. All the people who served the SMI conference organization
                will be invited to be members of the Council. Examples of service include chairing and co-chairing the
                SMI conference and chairing and co-chairing SMI technical paper committee. The SMI steering committee
                (see below) will be responsible for maintaining a mailing list of the SMI Council. Steering Committee
                can also invite significant contributors, such as SMI Award recipients, to the Council. SMI Council
                meets at least once every year. SMI Steering committee will be responsible for calling meetings. The
                council members will not terminate unless a member resigns from the council.
            </p>

            <h3 id="steering">SMI Steering Committee</h3>
            <p>
                Steering Committee consists of eight representatives of the council who are elected by the Shape
                Modeling International Community. Each member is elected for four years. At the beginning, half of the
                first steering committee will be elected for two years, and the rest of the committee will be elected
                for four years. After that, there will be an election every two years or when there is a vacancy. In
                each of the elections, four members will be elected every two years. There will also be one
                representative from the Computers & Graphics journal. Potential candidates will be identified by
                nominations in SMI Council. Self-nominations will also be considered. In nominations, the council should
                be sure that the steering committee must represent the geographic and gender diversity of the SMI
                community. </p>
            <p>
                Steering Committee elects a chair among its members. The chair organizes the Steering Committee meetings
                and manages the agenda. The steering committee meets every month and makes decisions about the SMI
                conference, such as selection of location and dates, selection of conference organizers, conference
                proceedings, "permanent" sponsorship, in-cooperation agreements, and co-location with other events.
                The steering committee will also keep track of the Council and Community email list and update the lists
                continuously. </p>
            <p>
                Steering Committee will actively look for potential venues to host future SMI conferences at least two
                years in advance. The committee will also work to identify the local organizing committee, and estimate
                of the local costs for the conference (location of the venue and audio-visual equipment, support staff,
                food, registration, promotion, materials) and for the participants (hotel costs, local travel).
            </p>

            <h2 id="conforg">Conference Organization</h2>
            <p>
                The Shape Modeling International conference is organized by the SMI Organization Committee, which
                consists of three conference chairs, three technical paper chairs, three communication chairs, and at
                least one Representative of the Steering Committee. The committee must represent the geographic and
                gender diversity of the SMI community. This committee meets weekly starting at least six months before
                the conference. </p>
            <p>
                The SMI organizing committee is appointed by the steering committee at least 18 months before the
                conference. The responsibilities of the organizing committee include (but are not limited to):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Finalize the date of the conference, considering that May or June are the traditional months of SMI,
                    and avoiding conflicts with other events in related disciplines (date to be approved by the steering
                    committee and to be announced during the current year conference);</li>
                <li>Provide financial plans (to be checked by the steering committee);</li>
                <li>Finalize the call for papers (to be approved by the steering committee and the draft version to be
